## Project description
For this project I had to map a student's first and last name to an id which means in other words map a string to an integer. Each student's name will map to a single 32-bit integer. I will also have to display the performance search as well as the performance of how many. 

## How to compiles / run the program

The program is ran through a site called apex.oracle. 

## UI Design
 Pretty much we would add different amounts of inventory to the back of house, add employees, add shipments, so on and so forth. It would display as shown in the figures. Figure 1 displays the home screen along with the side panel displaying what all is going to be given data. Figure 2 displays the back of house with given inventory along with different names and locations. Figure 3 displays the ERD diagram we used to make this app.

## 3. Additional Considerations

This project is something I feel as though companies can use to keep up with inventory as far as where it goes, how much they have, what they are receviing and what is outdated.

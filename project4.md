## Project description
For this project I had to map a student's first and last name to an id which means in other words map a string to an integer. Each student's name will map to a single 32-bit integer. I will also have to display the performance search as well as the performance of how many. 

## How to compiles / run the program

The program is ran through the terminal on ubuntu. 

## UI Design

## 3. Additional Considerations

This project is something I wasn't too confident with due to not being so strong suited when it came to mapping things. Overall this was a pretty good and in depth project.

## Project description
For this project my partner and I had to create a mobile app based on whatever we wanted it to be. We decided to do an Inventory app to keep up with the inventory for Nike since COVID-19 has started. Inventory was backed up due to the fact that the virus came around. This app will keep track of outdated inventory as well as new inventory along with the shipments coming in and going out.

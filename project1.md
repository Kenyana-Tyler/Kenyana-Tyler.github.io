## Project description
For this project my partner and I had to create a mobile app based on whatever we wanted it to be. We decided to do an Inventory app to keep up with the inventory for Nike since COVID-19 has started. Inventory was backed up due to the fact that the virus came around. This app will keep track of outdated inventory as well as new inventory along with the shipments coming in and going out. 

## How to compiles / run the program

The program is ran through a site called apex.oracle. 

## UI Design
 Pretty much we would add different amounts of inventory to the back of house, add employees, add shipments, so on and so forth. It would display as shown in the figures. Figure 1 displays the home screen along with the side panel displaying what all is going to be given data. Figure 2 displays the back of house with given inventory along with different names and locations. Figure 3 displays the ERD diagram we used to make this app.

## 3. Additional Considerations

This project is something I feel as though companies can use to keep up with inventory as far as where it goes, how much they have, what they are receviing and what is outdated.

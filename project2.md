## Project description
For this project I had to created a website displaying the 5 different labs for the class, an about me page, a page of pictures, videos, and about my family. We used Ubuntu to make this and run the program. 

## How to compiles / run the program
To run the program we used mozilla firefox and typed in our own personal link that we had to pull up the website.

## 3. Additional Considerations

This project is a representation of everything I've learned throughout the class from adding music, to making different pages by coding it, as well as adding pictures and paragraphs.
